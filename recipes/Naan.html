      <h2>Ingredients Needed</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 ¼ cups self-rising flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup whole-milk Greek yogurt </li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <p></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Mix self-rising flour and Greek yogurt together
             in a large bowl until combined. Transfer to a 
             lightly floured work surface and knead until 
             smooth, adding more flour as necessary to keep 
             dough from sticking, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pat dough into a rough 9x7-inch rectangle. Divide
             into 8 equal pieces. Lightly dust each piece with
              flour and flatten into a semi-rectangular shape,
               about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Lightly grease a large skillet and place it over
             medium heat. Add 1 or 2 of the flattened dough 
             pieces to the skillet. Cook until they begin to 
             bubble and brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip over and 
             cook an additional 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from 
             heat and repeat with remaining dough until all 
             pieces are cooked. Serve warm.</li>
      </ol>
